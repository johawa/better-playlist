node is a VH engine wich was taken out of google chrome
.gitignore is the stuff we dont want to have in version control

- transpilation: with node, a old browser can use modern java 
- bundling: get all the components and bundle them together => much faster

1. $npm install -g create-react-app

2. to create a new react-app
   - cd into Folder 
   - then $create-react-app nameOfYourApp
   - bsp: $create-react-app better-playlists

3. cd into the directory u created and then $npm start

4.react.js is using a mix of java, html and css
  wich is calles JSX (see more https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
  - allowes to use variables inside of html
    like {variable} // to define this varibale:
    let variable =  'App Name'
    within {} you can put javascript code
  - instead of html class u say className
  - inlineStyle like style="color: 'green'"  
    is written as style={{color: green}};
    with the declared variable, let green = 'green'
    so u are passing in objects

    or like let headerStyle = {color: 'green', 'font-size': '50px}
    <h1 style={headerSytle} Hello </h1>

5. to create a new react class

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
     ----FIlL with JSX---    
    );
  }
}

6. 
let defaultStyle = {
  color: '#ffff'
}
add defualtStyle like: styll={{...defaultStyle, xxx:xxx, xxx:xxx}}

7. Add to Github

gives you version control !
workes like a cloud
